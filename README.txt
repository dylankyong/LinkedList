In order to complete this lab, a library must be created to perform all the expected LinkedList functions. This includes New(), CreateAfter(), GetFirst(), GetSize(), Print(), SwapData() and Sort(). These create new ListItems, add ListItems, return the first Item in a sequence, get the size of the ListItem sequence, print the ListItem sequence, swap two ListItems and sort the ListItem sequence first by length and then by alphabetical. These are tested in the LinkedListTest file. After the LinkedList file is bug tested, it is applied in the sort file. This file uses functions that were created in the LinkedList file. The sort function has an existing unsorted list word count function. However, a sorted list word count function must be written to be faster than the existing unsorted function. The most important aspects include thoroughly bug testing LinkedList before starting sort. This prevents any unwanted bugs from cropping up late in the lab. The sort function helps to smooth out the remaining bugs.

Coming into this lab, I had no idea what I was doing or where to start. I discussed the theory behind a doubly linked list with Shimon and after drawing a diagram out, I understood the lab framework. I read through the entire manual and spent sometime watching online lectures from last year's CE13 course to get a better grasp on the lab's concepts. As I went though the lab, I spent a majority of my time handling errors when sorting NULL data in the linked list. I felt that this lab was well planned out and I finished with a comfortable amount of time will far less stress than previous labs. I found that Shimon's guidance on the lab concepts was my spark for this lab and it helped me get over that initial hump.

The lab turned out pretty smooth in the end. However, I spent a much larger amount of time on this lab in comparison to previous ones. The NULL data in particular was very tedious as I had to go through line by line and figure out which one of my pointers was in the wrong place. This task alone took 6-8 hours with the rest of the lab including research taking 20-30 hours. I felt that the lab manual could have been a bit clearer on certain parts, but overall was very concise and clear. The final framework on the second to last page was confusing as I wasn't sure if the clear function was in the counter function or not ("Now your code within main() in sort.c will use SortedWorkCount() will perform the
following steps"). In the end I figured that they were two seperate things. This was the strike week so I didn't have any external help except for a few piazza postings. I managed to make it to Max's office hours, but I had questions nonlab related. The class videos online helped immensely in creating the opening framework for this lab.
